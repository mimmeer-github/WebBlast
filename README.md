# WebBlast
Web programming, made easy. How? WebBlast will use a simple programming structure.

## Why did I make this?
No paragraph will do, what about a numbered list instead:
1. I was tired of JS and it's strange functionallity for some things,
2. It's good to learn JS
Why did I open-source it?
1. My head's honestly spinning.

## How to use (in the future)
WebBlast is... 0% done. But here's how to use it when it finishes!

### The Command Structure
Commands use a Name(Args); system, but how do the arguments work?
These are the argument types: `"string"`, `'string'`, `<#colour>` and `{other functions}`.

### Command Set
WebBlast needs commands! But there's one issue, I... don't... have... any... yet.
That's why you need to...

## Contribute!
You can contribute by making pull requests and issues.
This is useful to help me advance WebBlast to v1.0.0!
